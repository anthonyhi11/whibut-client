## ABOUT

Have you ever been at lunch with friends and been posed the question... "Anthony, what have you been up to?"
Panic sets in... "what have I been up to?" you ask yourself. If you're anything like me, you've been:

1. Binging shows (HBO, NETFLIX, HULU, AMAZON PRIME)
2. Eating at Restaurants/Bars
3. Reading Books
4. Seeing Movies

But in that moment your mind goes completely blank... "What HAVE I been up to?"
Now, you can pull out your phone and pull up WHIBUT and with one glance, can inform
the overly-inquisitive 'friend' all that you've been up to.

With WHIBUT, after binging a show, watching a movie, visiting a restaurant, or reading a book,
you can quickly input one of those 4 activities into a table that can be viewed in the future when giving recommendations
or recalling that awesome restaurant with the hatch chile gravy you went to 3 weekends ago with Brad.

Under each category, you'll be presented with a simple form to quickly jot down the important points and give the activity
a rating so that when you are pressed with the horrible question: "what's the best place to take my mother-in-law this weekend", you can answer confidently and even give tips on what to order.

Don't fear the office happy hour. You'll feel like a cultural polymath.
