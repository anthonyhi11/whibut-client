WHIBUT - What Have I Been Up To? (name pending user research)

Have you ever been at lunch with friends and been posed the question... "Anthony, what have you been up to?"
Panic sets in... "what have I been up to?" you ask yourself. If you're anything like me, you've been:
1. Binging shows (HBO, NETFLIX, HULU, AMAZON PRIME)
2. Eating at Restaurants/Bars
3. Reading Books
4. Seeing Movies

But in that moment your mind goes completely blank... "What HAVE I been up to?"
Now, you can pull out your phone and pull up WHIBUT (name pending user research) and with one glance, can inform 
the overly-inquisitive 'friend' all that you've been up to. 

With WHIBUT (name pending user research), after binging a show, watching a movie, visiting a restaurant, or reading a book, 
you can quickly input one of those 4 activities into a table that can be viewed in the future when giving recommendations
or recalling that awesome restaurant with the hatch chile gravy you went to 3 weekends ago with Brad. 

Under each category, you'll be presented with a simple form to quickly jot down the important points and give the activity
a rating so that when you are pressed with the horrible question: "what's the best place to take my mother-in-law this weekend", you can answer confidently and even give tips on what to order. 

Don't fear the office happy hour. You'll feel like a cultural polymath.
